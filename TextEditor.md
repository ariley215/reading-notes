## Commands

**pwd** print working directory

**ls** list

**cd** change directory

**mkdir** create a directory

**touch** create new file

Whenever we refer to either a file or directory on the command line, we are in fact referring to a *path*. ie. A *path* is a means to get to a particular file or directory on the system.

Arguments are extra instructions given to a command
    -  ( /etc ). When we do this it tells ls not to list our current directory but instead to list that directories contents.

cd projects 
    
    1. move to projects directory

mkdir new-project
   
    2. creates new directory titled new-project

touch new-project/newfile.md
   
    3. creates a new file in the new-project directory

cd ..
    
    4. This moves us to the directory that is back one level

ls projects/new-project
   
    5. this will list everything in the new-project directory
