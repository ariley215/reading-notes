# Flex Boxes

- The element we've given a display value of *flex* to is acting like a block-level element in terms of how it interacts with the rest of the page, but its children are laid out as flex items
  - use a display value of inline-flex if you wish to lay out an element's children as flex items, but have that element behave like an inline element.

Flex boxes excel at taking a bunch of items which have different sizes, and returning the best layout for those items.

Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content.

Items in the layout can be visually reordered, away from their order in the DOM. 

- The alignment of the elements is focused on one axis, the horizontal (main axis) or vertical(cross axis).

- Using any properties that reorder the visual display away from how things are ordered in the HTML document will negatively impact the accesability of the page.
  - ex. row-reverse and column-reverse values.

flexbox over float
- flexboxes use less code for more complex layouts
- flex boxes adjust their size and position based on available space.
- can change the order of items with messing the HTML order.
- less workarounds than with float.
