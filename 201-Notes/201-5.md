# HTML Media

## Image file types

APNG (Animated Portable Network Graphics)

- ideal for basic animations that do not need to synchronize to other activities or to a sound track, such as progress indicators, activity throbber, and other animated sequences.

AV1 Image File Format (AVIF)

- powerful, open source, royalty-free file format that encodes AV1 bitstreams in the High Efficiency Image File Format (HEIF) container.
- AVIF has potential to become the "next big thing" for sharing images in web content.
- AVIF does not support progressive rendering, so files must be fully downloaded before they can be displayed

BMP (Bitmap image)

- most prevalent on Windows computers, and is generally used only for special cases in web apps and content.
- typically avoid using BMP files for website content. 

GIF (Graphics Interchange Format)

- GIF was one of the first two graphics formats supported by HTML

JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group image)

- Image format is currently the most widely used lossy compression format for still images.
- a data format for compressed photos, rather than a file type.

PNG (Portable Network Graphics)

- Image format uses lossless compression, while supporting higher color depths than GIF and being more efficient

SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)

- Format that specifies the contents of an image as a set of drawing commands that create shapes, lines, apply colors, and filters.
- ideal for diagrams, icons, and other images which can be accurately drawn at any size
- Popular for user interface elements in modern web design.
- SVG files are text files containing source code that, when interpreted, draws the desired image

TIFF (Tagged Image File Format)

- graphics file format which was created to store scanned photos, although it can be any kind of image.
- contain larger images than other formats.
-supports a variety of color spaces, not just RGB.
  - makes it a good choice for storing images intended for print film or television media.

WebP image

- images are on average 25â€“35% smaller than JPEG images of visually similar compression levels.
- images are typically 26% smaller than the same images in PNG format.
- supports animation and looping.
- has broad support but not historical.

XBM (X Window System Bitmap file)

- first to be supported on the Web but are no longer used and should be avoided.
  - format has security concerns.
- only found in older content.

Fallback images can be provided in a *<picture element*

- each specifying a version of the image in a different format or under different media conditions, as well as an *<img element* which defines where to display the image and the fallback to the default or "most compatible" version

# Learn CSS

the *foreground* would be like the text that is displayed on a page and the *backround* in color of the page that the text is sitting on.

Things that can have color- text, boxes, borders, SVG.


What do *font-size* - how many pixels big the text will be. 

*font-weight*- how **bold** the text will be. 

*font-style* italicizes the text.
