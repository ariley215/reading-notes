Why should tables not be used for page layouts? they reduce accessibility for visually impaired users. The complex markup produces confusing output for screen readers.
The code is harder to write and maintain. The sizing of tables means more effort has to be made for the layout to work on different types of devices.

List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML <table>.

1. <td> element creates a table cell, the smallest container of data in a table.

2. <tr> table row element. this is where the number <td> (data cells) you want in a row will live.

3. <th> table header element. cells that are at the beginning of a row or columnn.

*constructor* - function called using the **new** keyword.

- easier than having multiple objects used repeatedly.

calling(invoking) a *constructor*

- Creates a new object
- Binds **this** to the new object, so you can refer to **this** in your constructor code
- Runs the code in the constructor
- Returns the new object.

the term **this** when used in an *object literal* - When you use "this" within an object literal, it refers to the object in which it is defined. 

when used in a *constructor*-"this" is used to set properties on the newly created object? 

Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.
