# Local Storage

The main problem with HTTP as the main transport layer of the Web is that it is *stateless*.

-when the application is closed the state is reset the next time it is opened.


A *cookie* is a text file hosted on the userâ€™s computer and connected to the domain that your website runs on.

- Limitations:
  - they make the load larger for all the documents accessed on the domain.
  - only allow up to 4KB of data storage.
  - security concious people often turn them off or ask for limitations on the cookies being set.

**Local storage** - modify the *localStorage* object in JS using the setItem() or getItem() method.

- Can only store strings in the different keys.
  - using the native JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse() methods, works around this limitation.

**sessionStorage** - maintains the data only while the browser window is open.

- localStorage.setItem( 'car', JSON.stringify(car) );
console.log( JSON.parse( localStorage.getItem( 'car' ) ) );

**caching** data from the Web when it takes a long time to get is a type of local storage.

- Local caching keeps you from being banned from services, and it also means that when a call to the API fails for some reason, you will still have information to display.
