# Web and JavaScript Basics

HTTP, a web's courier, in code they speak,

Requests and responses, across wires they streak.

From client to server, they swiftly roam,

In the language of the web, they find their home.

(I am not poetically inclined so thanks chatGPT)


**JavaScript** is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages like dynamic content and form validation.

*Parsing* - the step the browser takes to turn the data it receives over the network into the DOM and CSSOM, which is used by the renderer to paint a page to the screen.

create a String in JS - enclosed in single quotations

create a number in JS - a number (6, not six) without quotations

Variables are containers that store values.

- You start by declaring a variable with the 'let' keyword, followed by the name you give to the variable:

# Introduction to HTML

- HTML content wrapped in tags. It tells the browser the meaning of the content.

  - opening
  - closing
  - self closing

- **Attributes**- have extra info that you don't want to appear in the content.

- **Semantic**- refers the meaning of a piece of code.

  - eg. what effect does running that line have? (rather than " what does it look like")
  - *semantic element*- it's name is it's job.

*Tip for semantic markup*

- When approaching which markup to use, ask yourself, "What element(s) best describe/represent the data that I'm going to populate?" For example, is it a list of data?; ordered, unordered?; is it an article with sections and an aside of related information?; does it list out definitions?; is it a figure or image that needs a caption?; should it have a header and a footer in addition to the global site-wide header and footer?; etc.

<span is an inline **non-semantic element**, which you should only use if you cant think of a better semantic text element to wrap your content, or dont want to add any specific meaning.

*article* an enclosed block of content that makes sense on its own without the rest of the page (e.g., a magazine article).

*section* is for grouping together a part of the page that constitutes a sintle piece of functionality (e.g., a mini map, or music), or an overall theme within in.

**Tip** - begin each *section* with a heading

- *articles* up into different *sections*, or *sections* up into different *articles*, depending on the context.

Using a *<script* tag you can add JavaScript to an HTML document.

<meta HTML tag used when specifying metadata in the <head

More metadata = end up higher on the relevency page for search engines.

Metadata is data that describes data, and HTML has an "official" way of adding metadata to a document

- The HTML head is the contents of the <head element. The content inside of it is not seen on the webpage. Its purpose is to contain **metadata** about the document.

Questions you should answer before designing a website:

1. What exactly do I want to accomplish?

2. How will a website help me reach my goals?

3. What needs to be done, and in what order, to reach my goals?

*Project Ideation*- a necessary first step to reach your goal.
