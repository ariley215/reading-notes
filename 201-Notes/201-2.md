# Basics of HTML, CSS & JS

Semantic elements are important for making sure we are using the correct elements, giving our content the correct meaning, function, or appearance.

There are six levels of headings in HTML

    - h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6.
    - you should use a single <h1 per page.
    - Make sure you use the headings in the correct order in the hierarchy.
    -use no more than 3 per page.

*<span element*- It has no semantics. You use it to wrap content when you want to apply CSS to it (or do something to it with JavaScript) without giving it any extra meaning.

*<sup element*- element is used to define text that should be displayed as superscript
-  text appears smaller and higher than the surrounding text 
- used for math notations, copyright, and trademark symbols.

*<abbr element*- to wrap around an abbreviation or acronym

- provide a full expansion of the term in plain text on first use

- if the abbreviation or acronym is a fairly shortened term, provide the full expansion of the term as the value of <title attribute

*Description Lists*- mark up a set of items and their associated descriptions, such as terms and definitions, or questions and answers.
