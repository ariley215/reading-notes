 5 form elements 
 
 - Form elements are essential components of web forms that allow users to input data and interact with websites and applications. Here are five form elements and their importance:

1. **Text Input (Input Type: "text")**:
   - **Importance**: Text input fields are one of the most common form elements. They allow users to enter text-based information such as names, email addresses, usernames, and comments. They are versatile and can be used for a wide range of purposes, making them a fundamental element in most forms.

2. **Radio Buttons (Input Type: "radio")**:
   - **Importance**: Radio buttons allow users to make a single selection from a list of options. They are important for multiple-choice questions, where only one answer is correct or applicable. Radio buttons help ensure that users provide a single, specific response.

3. **Checkboxes (Input Type: "checkbox")**:
   - **Importance**: Checkboxes enable users to make multiple selections from a list of options. They are used when users can choose one or more items from a set. For example, checkboxes are often used for selecting multiple interests or preferences.

4. **Dropdown Select (Select Element)**:
   - **Importance**: Dropdown select elements provide a compact way to present a list of options while conserving screen space. Users can choose from a predefined set of options. Dropdowns are valuable for scenarios where there are multiple choices but space is limited, such as selecting a country or state.

5. **Textarea (Input Type: "textarea")**:
   - **Importance**: Textareas are used for longer text input, such as comments, reviews, or messages. They allow users to input multi-line text, making them crucial for situations where users need to provide detailed or extended responses. Textareas are often used in contact forms, comment sections, and text entry fields.




How would you describe events to a non-technical friend? They are the actions and reactions that take place on a webpage. Its the input output conversation that the user is having with the computer.

 addEventListener() method needs:

- the event type
  - a string
- event handler
  a function

*event objects* - inside an event handler function, a parameter specified with a name such as event, evt, or e.

- always a reference to the element the event occurred upon.

## Event bubbling vs. Event capturing

- Both determine the order in which event handlers are executed when an event occurs on a DOM element
- They describe how the browser handles events targeted at nested elements.

*bubbling* -the event starts from the target element that triggered the event and then "bubbles up" through the DOM hierarchy, propagating through the ancestors of the target element.
*capturing* -the even starts from the root and goes down rather than up.
