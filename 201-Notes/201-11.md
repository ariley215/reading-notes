# Audio, Video, Images

Explain how the ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved since the early 2000s: Online video and audio files used to use a proprietary plug in bas tech. They had accessability and security issues that have made them obsolete. Rise in OVP's and mobile usage of video and audio content has changed user interact with these types of files.

**src** - In the same way as for the <img> element, the src (source) attribute contains a path to the video you want to embed. It works in exactly the same way.

**controls** - The needs to be able to control the playback. Use the controls attribute to include the browser's own control interface, or build your interface using the appropriate JavaScript API.

**fallback content** - The paragraph inside the <video> tags, so that if the users browser doesn't support the video, they still have a way to acess the video.

In the digital world, Audio and Video were inseparable friends. Audio had a captivating voice, while Video was a visual storyteller. Together, they created unforgettable online experiences.

One day, they faced a challenge. Collaborating on a complex project, they realized the power of their friendship. Their work left a lasting impression, inspiring countless people.

From that day forward, Audio and Video continued to weave their magic, creating something truly extraordinary—a symphony of sight and sound that touched the hearts and souls of their audience.

The <audio> element doesn't support the width/height attributes. 

- There is no visual component, so there is nothing to assign a width or height to.
- It also doesn't support the poster attribute — again, no visual component.

Each web browser supports an assortment of *codecs*, like Vorbis or H.264, which are used to convert the compressed audio and video into binary data and back.

- Things become slightly more complicated because not only does each browser support a different set of container file formats, they also each support a different selection of codecs. In order to maximize the likelihood that your website or app will work on a user's browser, you may need to provide each media file you use in multiple formats.

Grid is the very first CSS module created specifically to solve the layout problems we’ve all been hacking our way around for as long as we’ve been making websites.

- Similarly to flexbox, the source order of the grid items doesn’t matter

*Grid Container*- It’s the direct parent of all the grid items.

*Grid Item*- The children of the grid container.

*Grid Line*- the lines that make up the structure of the grid. Either horizontal or vertical.(column or row grid lines)

*Grid Cell*- The space between two adjacent row and two adjacent column grid lines.

*Grid Area*- the total space surrounded by the four grid lines.

*Grid Track*- the space between two adjacent grid lines.

Similarly to flexbox, the source order of the grid items doesn’t matter. Grid allows for 2 dimensional flow as opposed to flexbox which only allows for 1.

*Responsive image* technologies were implemented recently to solve the **resolutions switching problem** by letting you offer the browser several image files, either all showing the same thing but containing different numbers of pixels (resolution switching), or different images suitable for different space allocations (art direction).

*art direction problem* - wanting to change the image displayed to suit different image display sizes.

Besides making a site visually appealing across different screen sizes, why should developers make images responsive?

- Improved user experience
- Reduced bandwith usage
- Contributes to web accessibility

*srcset* - defines the set of images we will allow the browser to choose between, and what size each image is.

1. An image filename (elva-fairy-480w.jpg)
2. A space
3. The image's intrinsic width in pixels 

*sizes*- efines a set of media conditions (e.g. screen widths) and indicates what image size would be best to choose, when certain media conditions are true.

1. A media condition.
2. A space
3. The width of the slot the image will fill when the media condition is true.

- They both provide several additional source images along with hints to help the browser pick the right one.

img src="default-image.jpg" alt="Description of the image"

srcset="image-small.jpg 320w, image-medium.jpg 640w, image-large.jpg 1200w"

sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, (max-width: 1200px) 50vw, 25vw">

*srcset* more helpful for responsive images than CSS or JavaScript because it can optimize image loading speed.
