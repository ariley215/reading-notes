# Chart.js and Canvas

What does the allow a developer to acheive?
*<canvas* - element that allows you to draw 2D graphics using JavaScript.

- requires two attributes: width and height properties.
  -Can also change the width and height of the <canvas> element using the DOM methods:

Any content between the opening and closing tags is fallback content that will display only if the browser doesnâ€™t support the <canvas> element.

Initially, the canvas is blank. To draw something, you need to access the rendering context and use it to draw on the canvas.

- features the getContext() method that returns a render context object.


Explain what the getContext() method does.

*Chart.js* - well documented plugin that makes using all kinds of bar charts, line charts, pie charts and more, incredibly easy.

- Copy the Chart.min.js out of the unzipped folder and into the directory you'll be working in. Then create a new html page and import the script.

Charts are far better for displaying data visually than tables and have the added benefit that no one is ever going to press-gang them into use as a layout tool.

- Simple to use and really very flexible.

How could Chart.js aid your previously created applications visually?
