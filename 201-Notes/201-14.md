# CSS Transitions and Animation

These provide a more appealing and interactive experience for the user, using animated changes to different elements of the web application.

The transform property comes in two different settings, two-dimensional and three-dimensional.

- Two-dimensional transforms work on the x and y axes, known as horizontal and vertical axes. Three-dimensional transforms work on both the x and y axes, as well as the z axis.

- Browser support for the transform property isnâ€™t great.

- It can be used to make an element spin or change in size when the mouse hovers over it.


**CSS animation**: - They arent tied to state changes. They can be engaged independently from an event.
-More powerful

- Offer more flexibilty and control

**CSS transition**: - Simpler syntax

There are four transition related properties in total, including *transition-property*, 
*transition-duration*, *transition-timing-function,* and *transition-delay*.

If multiple properties need to be transitioned they may be comma separated within the transition-property value. Additionally, the keyword value **all** may be used to transition all properties of an element.

**Not all properties may be transitioned**, only properties that have an identifiable halfway point.
