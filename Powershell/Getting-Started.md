 I need an Excel spreadsheet that has the list of all of the services for a specific system on your network that are stopped:

```powershell

get-service |
where-Object Status -eq 'Stoppped' |
select-object Name, Status
# repsonse is held in variable 
$data = get-service | where-Object Satus -eq 'Stopped' | select-object Name, Status
$data | out-file .\services.csv
notepad .\services.csv
# opens in the notepad app
$data | export-csv .\Services2.csv
get-content .\services2.csv
# pulls content from the file into Powershell
#out put will be the data comma seperated and ready for excel
$ImportData = import-csv -Path .\services2.csv
# this will bring the data back into Powershell
```
use 'get-content' if you want to parse a text file or other data source
