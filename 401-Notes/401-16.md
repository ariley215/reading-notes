# Serverless Functions

## Serverless Computing:

**Key Characteristics:**

*No server management:* Developers focus on code, not infrastructure provisioning or maintenance.

*Automatic scaling:* Infrastructure scales up or down based on demand, optimizing resource usage and costs.

*Pay-per-use:* Billing is based on actual function executions and resource consumption, not reserved capacity.

*Faster deployment:* Code can be deployed and updated quickly without lengthy server configuration processes.

*Event-driven architecture:* Functions often respond to events (e.g., HTTP requests, file uploads, database changes), promoting a reactive approach.

Differences from Traditional Server-Based Architectures:

| Characteristic | Serverless Computing | Traditional Server-Based Architectures |
|---|---|---|
| Infrastructure management | Managed by cloud provider | Managed by developers or IT teams |
| Scaling | Automatic | Manual configuration |
| Billing | Pay-per-use | Fixed costs for server resources |
| Deployment | Faster | Can be slower due to server setup |
| Architecture | Often event-driven | Typically request-response or monolithic |

Getting Started with Vercel:

1. Create an Account: Sign up for a free Vercel account at <https://vercel.com/>.
2. Install the Vercel CLI: Install the Vercel Command-Line Interface (CLI) globally using npm install -g vercel.
3. Initialize a Project: In your project directory, run vercel init to create a vercel.json configuration file.
4. Deploy Your Function: Run vercel to deploy your serverless function. Vercel will automatically detect your functions and handle deployment.

Key Steps for Deploying a Serverless Function:

Write your function code (usually in JavaScript or TypeScript).
Define function triggers (e.g., HTTP requests, events).
Configure environment variables if needed.
Run vercel to deploy.
APIs (Application Programming Interfaces):

APIs are interfaces that allow applications to interact with each other and exchange data.
They provide a set of rules and specifications for how to make requests and receive responses.
Python applications can utilize APIs to access data from external sources like databases, social media platforms, weather services, and more.
Using APIs in Python with Requests Library:

Requests: A popular Python library for interacting with APIs by sending HTTP requests.
Basic GET request example

```python
import requests

response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data')  # Replace with the actual API endpoint

if response.status_code == 200:
    data = response.json()  # Parse JSON response (if applicable)
    print(data)
else:
    print("API request failed with status code:", response.status_code)


```
