# Engineering Readings

What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can? 

My unique prospective based on personal experiences.

What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

1. Start debugging
2. Reassess - is there a different way to do this?
  i. “Sometimes we get so lost in the details of a problem that we overlook general principles that would solve the problem at a more general level."
3. Research - google, chatGPT
  i. find solutions to small problems, not large ones.  

5 Why's

When a problem occurs, you drill down to its root cause by asking "Why?" five times.

Search for answers that are grounded in fact: they must be accounts of things that have actually happened, not guesses at what might have happened.

"Focus on the Princess and not the pits, to stick to the task and learn more."
