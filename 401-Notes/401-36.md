Practice, Practice, Practice:

- Regularly practice solving problems on a whiteboard or a piece of paper to get accustomed to coding without the aid of an IDE.
- Focus on your problem-solving skills and ability to communicate your thought process clearly.

Verbalize Your Thought Process:

- Communicate your thought process out loud as you solve the problem. Explain your approach, and don't hesitate to ask clarifying questions if needed.
- Interviewers often value the way you approach problem-solving as much as the correct solution.

Consider Edge Cases:

- Think about edge cases and potential corner cases for the problem at hand.
- Showing that you've considered different scenarios demonstrates a deeper understanding of the problem.

Ask Questions:

- Don't be afraid to ask questions to clarify requirements or discuss assumptions. It shows your engagement and can help you avoid pitfalls.

Time Management:

- Keep an eye on the time and manage it wisely. If you get stuck on a particular part of the problem, it might be better to move on and come back to it later.
