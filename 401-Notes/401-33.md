# Authentication & Production Server

**JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)** are a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims between two parties.

- Primary purpose of JWTs is to securely transmit information between parties in a compact and self-contained manner.
  - They consist of three parts: a header, a payload, and a signature.

*Header:* Contains information about how the JWT is encoded (e.g., using HMAC SHA256 or RSA).

*Payload:* Contains the claims (statements) about an entity (typically, the user).

*Signature:* Created by combining the encoded header, encoded payload, a secret, and the algorithm specified in the header.

- It helps verify that the sender of the JWT is who it says it is and ensures that the message wasn't changed along the way.

*Encoding:* The header and payload are JSON objects that are Base64Url encoded to form the first two parts of the JWT. They are concatenated with a period (.) separator.

*Decoding:* To decode, you split the JWT into its three components, decode each part using Base64Url, and then you can access the claims in the payload.

Django REST Framework (DRF) supports JWT authentication out of the box.

1. Installation:

- Install the djangorestframework and djangorestframework-jwt packages.

1. Settings:

- Configure Django settings to include the JWT authentication classes.

1. Token Generation:

- When a user logs in or authenticates, a JWT is generated and sent back as part of the response.

1. Token Inclusion:

- For subsequent requests, the client includes the JWT in the Authorization header.

1. Token Verification:

- The server verifies the token's integrity using the secret key and checks if it's still valid (not expired).

1. Protecting Views:

- Use DRF's @authentication_classes and @permission_classes decorators on views or viewsets to enforce JWT authentication.

Reasons Django's runserver not suitable for production environments:

*Performance:* It is single-threaded and not optimized for handling a large number of concurrent requests.

*Security:* It lacks necessary security features for production, exposing Django's internals.

*Reliability:* It may not handle edge cases well and might not be as robust as production-ready servers.

Alternative Production Servers:

Gunicorn (Green Unicorn):

- A widely used WSGI server for Django. It is easy to use and can handle multiple worker processes.

uWSGI:

- It supports various protocols and has advanced features.

Docker with ASGI (e.g., Daphne):

- For Django channels and asynchronous support, using Docker with ASGI servers like Daphne can be beneficial.

Nginx or Apache as Reverse Proxy:

- While not a replacement for a WSGI server, these can be used as reverse proxies to handle static files, SSL termination, and load balancing.
