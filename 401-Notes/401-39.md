## React Context

A feature in React that allows you to share values (like a theme, authentication state, etc.) between components without explicitly passing props through every level of the component tree.

*State Management:* Context is often used for managing global state in an application. Rather than lifting state up through multiple layers of components, you can use Context to provide a single source of truth that components can access.

*Data Sharing:* Context is useful for sharing data that is needed by many components, such as user authentication status, theme preferences, or language preferences. Instead of passing these data through props at each level, you can use Context to provide them globally.

**'useContext'**: a React Hook that allows functional components to subscribe to a context without introducing nesting.

```javascript
import React, { useContext } from 'react';
// Import the useContext hook from React.

const MyComponent = () => {
  const contextValue = useContext(MyContext);
  // Use useContext to access the value provided by a Context.Provider.
};
```

**Next.js:** React framework for building server-rendered (SSR) or static web applications. It aims to make React applications more scalable by providing a simple and efficient way to handle server-side rendering, routing, and other common tasks.
