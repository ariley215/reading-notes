# FileIO and Exceptions

 Open a file: open() built-in function. 
 
 - open() has a single required argument - the path to the file. 
 - open() has a single return, the file object.

 **You should always make sure that an open file is properly closed.**

- The *with* statement automatically takes care of closing the file once it leaves the with block, even in cases of error. 
  - second positional argument, *mode*
    - This argument is a string that contains multiple characters to represent how you want to open the file. (read-only, write, binary)


```python

with open('dog_breeds.txt') as reader:
    # Further file processing goes here
```

*file object* - an object exposing a file-oriented API (with methods such as read() or write()) to an underlying resource.

*Read Method* read() / .read - This reads from the file based on the number of size bytes. If no argument is passed or None or -1 is passed, then the entire file is read.

*Readlines Method* readline() / .readline - This reads at most size number of characters from the line. This continues to the end of the line and then wraps back around.

```python

# Open a file in read mode
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    # Read the entire content of the file
    content = file.read()

# Display the content
print(content)



# Open a file in read mode
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    # Read the first line of the file
    first_line = file.readline()

# Display the first line
print(first_line)


```

*Exception handling* is a programming concept that allows developers to gracefully manage and respond to unexpected errors or exceptional situations that may arise during the execution of a program.

**exception error** - whenever syntactically correct Python code results in an error.

- Instead of showing the message exception error, Python details what type of exception error was encountered.

When an exception occurs in a program running this function, the program will continue as well as inform you about the fact that the function call was not successful.

*except* is used to catch and handle the exception(s) that are encountered in the try clause.

*else* lets you code sections that should run only when no exceptions are encountered in the try clause.

*finally* enables you to execute sections of code that should always run, with or without any previously encountered exceptions.


 ```python
 try:
    # Code that might raise an exception
    num1 = int(input("Enter a numerator: "))
    num2 = int(input("Enter a denominator: "))
    result = num1 / num2

except ValueError:
    # Handle the case where the user didn't enter a valid integer
    print("Please enter valid integers.")

except ZeroDivisionError:
    # Handle the case where the denominator is zero
    print("Cannot divide by zero.")

else:
    # Code in this block runs if no exception occurred in the try block
    print("Result:", result)

finally:
    # Code in this block always runs, whether an exception occurred or not
    print("This is the finally block. It will be executed no matter what.")

 ```
