# Permissions & Postgresql

Permissions in DRF(Django Rest Framework) play a crucial role in controlling access to different parts of an API. They help in securing the API by defining who can perform certain actions.

By using different permission classes, you can enforce authentication, restrict access to certain user roles, and ensure that only authorized users can perform specific operations.

Permissions are applied at both the view level and the object level, allowing fine-grained control over who can read, write, or delete specific resources.

**BasePermission:** This is the base class for all permission classes in DRF. It provides a simple boolean interface for determining whether a request should be granted or denied access.

**IsAuthenticated:** A common permission class that ensures the user making the request is authenticated.

**IsAdminUser:** Restricts access to admin users only.

**IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly:** Allows read access to any user, but only allows write access to authenticated users.

**DjangoModelPermissions:** Ties into Django's built-in model-level permissions. Requires the user to have the necessary model-level permissions to perform actions.

**Custom Permissions:** Developers can create their own custom permission classes by subclassing BasePermission and implementing the has_permission or has_object_permission methods.

The **SELECT** statement in SQL is used to retrieve data from one or more tables in a database.

This query selects all columns (* denotes all columns) from the 'employees' table.

```python
SELECT * FROM employees;
```

*DRF Generic Views*: provide pre-built views for common actions in a RESTful API, simplifying the implementation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

- They abstract away a lot of the boilerplate code required to build API views, making it easier and faster to create API endpoints.

```python
from rest_framework.generics import ListAPIView
from .models import MyModel
from .serializers import MyModelSerializer

class MyModelListView(ListAPIView):
    queryset = MyModel.objects.all()
    serializer_class = MyModelSerializer
```

```python
class PlantDetailView(RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView):
    queryset = Plant.objects.all()
    serializer_class = PlantSerializer
```
