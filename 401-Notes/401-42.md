# Pythonisms

## Dunder Methods

"Dunder" stands for "double underscore," and dunder methods are special methods in Python that are surrounded by double underscores on both sides of their name.

- known as magic methods or special methods
- allow customization of built-in behavior in classes by providing a way to define specific operations that can be performed on instances of the class.

```python
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

    def __str__(self):
        return f"MyClass instance with value: {self.value}"

obj = MyClass(42)
print(str(obj))  # Output: MyClass instance with value: 42


# when str(obj) is called, it invokes the __str__ method of the MyClass instance, allowing you to provide a custom string representation.
```

A common dunder method is __str__, which is used to define the "informal" or human-readable string representation of an object when str() is called on it.

## Iterator in Python

**Iterator** an object that implements the __iter__ and __next__ dunder methods.

- The __iter__ method returns the iterator object itself
- The __next__ method returns the next value from the iterator.
- When there are no more items to return, it should raise the StopIteration exception.

```python
class MyRange:
    def __init__(self, start, end):
        self.current = start
        self.end = end

    def __iter__(self):
        return self

    def __next__(self):
        if self.current >= self.end:
            raise StopIteration
        else:
            self.current += 1
            return self.current - 1

# Usage:
my_range = MyRange(1, 5)
for num in my_range:
    print(num)
# Output: 1 2 3 4
```

## Generators

**Generators** a special type of iterator created using a function with the yield keyword.

- allows you to iterate over a potentially large sequence of data without creating the entire sequence in memory
- more memory-efficient than regular functions that return lists.

```python
def countdown(n):
    while n > 0:
        yield n
        n -= 1

# Usage:
for i in countdown(5):
    print(i)
# Output: 5 4 3 2 1
```

## Decorators

Decorators are a powerful feature in Python used to modify or extend the behavior of functions or methods.

- are applied using the @decorator syntax.
- take a function as input and return a new function.
  - extends or modifies the input function's behavior.

```python
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        func()
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

# Usage:
say_hello()

#my_decorator is a simple decorator that adds behavior before and after the say_hello function is called. The @my_decorator syntax is a shorthand way of applying the decorator to the say_hello function.
```
