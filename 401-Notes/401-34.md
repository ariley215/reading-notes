# API Deployment

Key Principles:

*Split settings into multiple files:* Divide settings into smaller, logical files such as base.py, development.py, production.py, etc., to improve readability and maintainability.

*Use environment variables:* Keep sensitive information, such as secret keys or database credentials, in environment variables rather than hardcoding them in the settings file. The python-decouple library is often used for this purpose.

*Use from_settings for configuration:* To ensure that your Django app can be easily reused, configure your apps to use settings from the project settings. This is done using the django.conf.settings object.

*Separate configuration for development and production:* Maintain separate settings for development and production environments to avoid potential security risks and optimize configurations.

**White Noise library:** used in Django applications to efficiently serve static files directly from the application itself, without relying on a separate server like Nginx or Apache.  

1. Install White Noise using pip install whitenoise.
1. Update the MIDDLEWARE setting in your settings.py to include whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware before django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware.
1. Ensure that your STATIC_URL and STATIC_ROOT settings are correctly configured.
1. Configure the STATICFILES_STORAGE setting to use White Noise:

```python
STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'whitenoise.storage.CompressedManifestStaticFilesStorage'
```

*Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)*: security feature implemented by web browsers to control access to resources on a different origin (domain). 

- It prevents web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the web page.

1. Install the django-cors-headers package using pip install django-cors-headers.
1. Add 'corsheaders.middleware.CorsMiddleware' to the MIDDLEWARE setting in your settings.py, and ensure it comes before Django's CommonMiddleware.
1. Adjust the allowed origins based on your specific needs.
1. Configure the CORS settings by adding the following to your settings.py:

```python
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS = [
    "http://localhost:3000",  # Example: Your frontend application's origin
    "https://yourproductiondomain.com",
]
```
