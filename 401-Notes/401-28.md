# Django CRUD and Forms

**Django Forms** - They abstract the HTML forms, validate user-submitted data, and streamline the process of processing form data. Forms in Django can be used to create, update, and delete records in the database, and they handle tasks like validation, converting data types, and displaying error messages.

Key Components:

*Form Class:* Defines the structure of the form, including fields and validation rules.

*Fields:* Represent the input fields in the HTML form (e.g., CharField, EmailField).

*Validation:* Includes built-in and custom validation rules for data integrity.

*Widgets:* Define the HTML representation of the form fields (e.g., TextInput, Select).

*CRUD Operations:* Can handle Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on models.

```python
from django import forms

class MyForm(forms.Form):
    name = forms.CharField(max_length=100)
    email = forms.EmailField()
```

**Django Templates** - used to generate dynamic HTML content by embedding Python-like code within HTML files.

- They allow developers to create dynamic and data-driven web pages by incorporating variables, loops, and control structures.

- Templates help separate the presentation layer from the business logic, improving code organization and maintainability.

*Template inheritance* - a powerful feature in Django that allows you to create a base template with the common structure and elements shared across multiple pages.

- Child templates can then extend the base template and override or add specific content as needed. 
  - This promotes code reusability and helps maintain a consistent layout throughout the application.

```python
<!-- base_template.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>{% block title %}Default Title{% endblock %}</title>
</head>
<body>
    <div id="content">
        {% block content %}{% endblock %}
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

```python
<!-- child_template.html -->
{% extends 'base_template.html' %}

{% block title %}Page Title{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
    <h1>Welcome to the page!</h1>
    <p>This is the content of the page.</p>
{% endblock %}
```

**Django Views**- Django Views handle incoming HTTP requests and return HTTP responses.

- They contain the business logic of the application and interact with models to retrieve or manipulate data.
- Views can be *function-based* or *class-based*, depending on the developer's preference and the complexity of the application

**Function-Based Views (FBV):**

Defined as Python functions.

Simpler and more straightforward for basic cases.

Defined using the def keyword.

Easy to understand for smaller applications.

Ex.

```python
from django.shortcuts import render

def my_view(request):
    return render(request, 'template.html')
```

Class-Based Views (CBV):

Defined as Python classes.

Offer more structure and organization for complex views.

Provide mixins and inheritance for code reuse.

Class-based and more object-oriented.

Ex.

```python
from django.views import View
from django.shortcuts import render

class MyView(View):
    def get(self, request):
        return render(request, 'template.html')
```
