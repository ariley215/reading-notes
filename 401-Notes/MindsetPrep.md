# Gentle Philosophy of Success
Career Anxiety
- snobbery - too much weight on our achievements

envy - linked to spirit of equality - 
  when you can't relate to someone, you don't envy them.

meritocracy - talent energy you will get to the top - 
-flip side: if you arent succeeding its because you're not working hard enough. 
  "its a sin to judge any man by his post" st. augustus city of the gods
our fear of failure comes from the judgement and ridicule it brings.
tradgedy art- provides sympathy to the failures of life.
success has to include the acknowledgement of the things your missing out on- can't have it all. - we have to define sucess for our individual selves not what society has deemed "successful"

## Grit

Smartest doens't always mean the best. Hard work CAN(not always) be a substitute for natural talent.

Grit - passion and perseverance for long term success.
talent doensn't make you gritty.
growth mindset helps build grit

## Power of Yet 

Not failing, just not there yet.

"From their more fixed mindeset, their intelligence had been up for judgment and they failed."

fixed mindset, "stuck in the tyranny of now."

praise wisely- praise the effort, the process, their improvements, their strategies.
  -reward process

eqaulity happens with the power of yet.
  the meaning of effort and difficulty were transformed.-
