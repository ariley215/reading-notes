# Cryptography

Caesar Cipher:

A substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

For example, with a shift of 3, A would be replaced by D, B would become E, and so on.

*Historical Use:* Julius Caesar is believed to have used this cipher to encode his private messages, though it's worth noting that this is a simple and easily breakable form of encryption by modern standards.

## Symmetric vs. Asymmetric Encryption:

**Symmetric Encryption:**

Key: Uses a single secret key for both encryption and decryption.

Speed: Generally faster than asymmetric encryption.

Use Case: Commonly used for bulk data encryption (e.g., file or disk encryption).

**Asymmetric Encryption**:

Key Pairs: Uses a pair of public and private keys for encryption and decryption.

Speed: Slower than symmetric encryption.

Use Case: Often used for secure key exchange, digital signatures, and secure communication.

- In modern secure communication, a common practice is to use asymmetric encryption for the initial exchange of secret keys and then switch to faster symmetric encryption for the actual data transfer.

Random Number Generation in Computers:

Pseudo-Random Number Generation (PRNG)

Algorithmic: Generated using algorithms.

Reproducibility: Outputs can be reproduced if the initial state is known.

Use Case: Generally used in most computer systems and applications where true randomness is not critical.

True Random Number Generation (TRNG):

Source of Entropy: Relies on physical processes (e.g., atmospheric noise, radioactive decay).

Unpredictability: Considered truly random.

Use Case: Critical for applications requiring high-level security, such as cryptographic key generation.

## Encryption vs. Decryption

Think of encryption and decryption like using a padlock and a key.

*Encryption:* Imagine you have a padlock (encryption key) and a box (your message). You put your message inside the box and lock it with the padlock. Now, only someone with the correct key can unlock and open the box to see the message.

*Decryption:* The recipient, possessing the correct key, can unlock the padlock and open the box to reveal the original message. In this way, the padlock and key act like the encryption and decryption keys in a cryptographic system.
