# Classes Objects Recursion Pytest

**Classes** - Blueprint for creating objects. It defines attributes and methods that the objects will have.

**Objects** - Instance of a class.

**Attributes** - These are variables that store data, defined within a class.

**Methods** - These are functions defined within a class that can perform actions on the attributes of the class or manipulate the object's state.

To create an instance of a class, you call the class as if it were a function, passing any required arguments.

```python

class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, attribute1, attribute2):
        self.attribute1 = attribute1
        self.attribute2 = attribute2

my_instance = MyClass(value1, value2)

```

To access attributes or call methods of an object, use dot notation

```python
print(my_instance.attribute1)

```

A *recursive function* is a function defined in terms of itself via self-referential expressions.

- This means that the function will continue to call itself and repeat its behavior until some condition is met to return a result. 
  - Contain a base case and a recursive case

```python
def factorial(n):
    # Base case: factorial of 0 is 1
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    # Recursive case: n! = n * (n-1)!
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

# Example usage:
number = 5
result = factorial(number)
print(f"The factorial of {number} is {result}")

```

**Best Practices**

1. Ensure a base case is defined to terminate recursion.
2. Make sure each recursive call moves towards the base case.
3. Be cautious about stack overflow for large inputs.
4. Understand and control the recursion depth.


*pytest fixtures* - Provide a way to set up, operate, and tear down resources needed for testing. They are defined using the @pytest.fixture decorator.

*code coverage* - Code coverage measures the percentage of code lines executed during testing. It helps identify untested code.

- Fixtures enhance test modularity and reusability.
- Code coverage ensures a higher percentage of the code is tested, reducing the likelihood of undetected bugs.
