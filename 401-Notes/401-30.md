# Django REST Framework & Docker

**Docker Image:** A lightweight, standalone, and executable software package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, libraries, and system tools.

**Container:** An instance of a Docker image that runs as a process on the host machine. Containers are isolated from each other and the host system, ensuring consistency in deployment across different environments.

**Dockerfile:** A script that contains instructions for building a Docker image. It defines the base image, sets up the environment, and specifies the steps to install dependencies and configure the application.

**Docker Engine:** The runtime that executes and manages Docker containers on the host system.

Benefits include:

**Portability:** Docker containers encapsulate an application and its dependencies, making it easy to move between different environments, from development to testing to production.

**Isolation:** Containers provide process isolation, ensuring that an application runs consistently across different environments without interference from external factors.

**Resource Efficiency:** Containers share the host OS kernel, reducing the overhead of virtualization and enabling efficient resource utilization.

**Scalability:** Containers can be easily scaled horizontally, allowing for the deployment of multiple instances of an application to handle varying workloads.

Basic Django Setup Steps:

1. Models: Define models for the library database.

```python
class Author(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    # Other fields...

class Genre(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    # Other fields...

class Book(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    author = models.ForeignKey(Author, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    genre = models.ManyToManyField(Genre)
    # Other fields...
```

1. Views: Create views to handle HTTP requests and interact with the models.

```python
from django.shortcuts import render
from .models import Book

def book_list(request):
    books = Book.objects.all()
    return render(request, 'library/book_list.html', {'books': books})
```

1. Templates: Design HTML templates to render data in a user-friendly format.

```html
<!-- library/book_list.html -->
{% for book in books %}
    <p>{{ book.title }} by {{ book.author.name }}</p>
{% endfor %}
```

1. URL Patterns: Define URL patterns in the urls.py file to map URLs to views.

```python
from django.urls import path
from .views import book_list

urlpatterns = [
    path('books/', book_list, name='book_list'),
    # Other URL patterns...
]
```

## Django vs. Django REST framework:

Django:

- A high-level web framework for building full-stack web applications.
- Designed for server-side rendering of HTML pages.
- Follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern.
- Uses Django ORM for database interactions.
- Templates are used for rendering HTML.

Django REST framework:

- An extension to Django for building Web APIs.
- Primarily used for developing RESTful APIs, supporting multiple data formats like JSON and XML.
- Follows the Model-View-Template (MVT) architectural pattern, similar to MVC but adapted for APIs.
- Serialization is used to convert complex data types to Python data types for rendering in responses.
- Authentication and permissions are explicitly handled for API endpoints.
