What are the key components of the Django framework, and how do they contribute to building a web application?

*Models:* Models define the data structure of the application, including how data is stored, retrieved, and queried in the database. Django uses Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) to map Python objects to database tables.

*Views:* Views handle the processing of data and business logic. They receive user input from the web and return an appropriate response, such as rendering a template or redirecting to another view. Views are responsible for interacting with the model to retrieve and manipulate data.

*Templates:* Templates define the presentation of data and are responsible for generating HTML to be sent to the client's browser. Django's template system allows for the dynamic generation of HTML by embedding Python-like expressions within the template.

*URLs:* The URL configuration maps URL patterns to views. It determines which view should handle a particular URL and helps in organizing the structure of the web application.

Django uses a slight variation of the more common **Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture**.

In a typical web request-response cycle in Django:

1. URLs are matched: The URL dispatcher identifies the view that corresponds to the requested URL.
1. View is called: The view processes the request, interacts with the model to fetch or manipulate data, and prepares the necessary data for rendering.
1. Template is rendered: The template is used to dynamically generate HTML, incorporating the data obtained from the view.
1. Response is sent: The HTML response is sent back to the client's browser.

*Tailwind CSS:* It is a utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level utility classes to build designs directly in your markup. It gives developers more flexibility and control over the design by providing a set of atomic classes for common styles. Developers can compose these classes to create custom designs without writing much custom CSS.

- Tailwind CSS provides a more granular and customizable approach to styling, while Bootstrap CSS offers a more structured and pre-designed set of components.
