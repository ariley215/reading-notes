# Django Models

**Django models** - serve as an abstraction layer for interacting with databases. They provide a way to define the structure of your database tables in a Pythonic manner. 

- The purpose of Django models is to represent your data models in code, allowing you to interact with the database without writing raw SQL queries. 
- Models define the fields and behaviors of the data you're storing and provide an easy way to perform database operations.
- Python class that subclasses django.db.models.Model
- Each attribute of the model represents a database field, and each field is specified as a class attribute.
- The fields define the type of data the model can hold (e.g., CharField, IntegerField), and additional parameters allow you to set constraints and behaviors.
- Models include methods to define the behavior of the data
  - such as custom methods or properties.

*ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)* system - interact with the database using Python code, making database operations more abstract and Pythonic.

```python
from django.db import models

class MyModel(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    age = models.IntegerField()
```

**Django Admin** - powerful, built-in feature that automatically generates a web-based interface for managing your database records. 

- It allows administrators to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the data.

Key features:

*Automatic Interface Generation:* Django Admin automatically generates an admin interface based on your models.
*Customization:* You can customize the appearance and behavior of the admin interface by defining ModelAdmin classes.
*Permissions:* Django Admin enforces user authentication and permissions to control access to certain parts of the admin interface.
*Filtering and Searching:* You can filter and search for records easily in the admin interface.
*Inline Editing:* Allows for inline editing of related models.

Customize- create a ModelAdmin class and register it with your model.

- allows you to define various settings and behaviors for the admin interface, such as customizing the display, adding filters, and overriding default behaviors.

```python
from django.contrib import admin

class MyModelAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    list_display = ('name', 'age')
    search_fields = ['name']

admin.site.register(MyModel, MyModelAdmin)
```

**Django Application Components and Workflow:**

These components form the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, where *models* represent the data, *views* handle the user interface and logic, and *templates* define the presentation layer.

*Key Components:*

Models: Define the data structure and interact with the database.

Views: Handle the logic for processing requests and returning appropriate responses.

Templates: Define the presentation layer using HTML and Django template language.

URLs: Map URLs to specific views.

*Workflow:*

Request: A user sends a request to a specific URL.

URLs: The Django URL dispatcher maps the URL to a corresponding view.

View: The view processes the request, interacts with models if necessary, and returns a response.

Models: If the view requires data, it interacts with models to retrieve or modify database records.

Templates: The view renders the data using templates to generate an HTML response.

Response: The HTML response is sent back to the user's browser.
