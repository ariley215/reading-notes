 **Regular Expressions in Python**: Python provides the re module for working with regular expressions. Regular expressions are powerful tools for pattern matching and searching in strings.

 ```python
 import re

# Define a pattern
pattern = re.compile(r'\b(\w+)\b')

# Example text
text = "This is a sample text with some words."

# Search for the pattern in the text
matches = pattern.findall(text)

# Print the matches
print(matches)
```

**shutil Module:**The shutil module in Python provides a higher-level interface for file and directory operations. It includes functions for copying, moving, and deleting files and directories.

- Builds on top of the os module and provides higher-level operations. It is more convenient for more complex tasks like handling file operations.

```python
import shutil

# Copy a file
shutil.copy('source_file.txt', 'destination_folder/')

# Copy a directory and its contents
shutil.copytree('source_folder/', 'destination_folder/')
```

**os module**: provides a lower-level interface to the operating system. It includes functions for basic file and directory operations, such as creating directories, listing directory contents, and deleting files.

- It's more suitable for simple tasks.

```python
import os

# Create a directory
os.mkdir('new_directory')

# List directory contents
files = os.listdir('directory_path')
```
