# Azure App Configuration Service

## Overview

Azure App Configuration is a service that provides a centralized place to manage application settings and feature flags.

- Useful for modern, distributed applications that have configuration settings spread across multiple components.

## Key Benefits of App Configuration

1. **Fully Managed Service**: Can be set up and configured in minutes.
2. **Flexible Key Representations**: Supports various data types and hierarchical structures.
3. **Tagging with Labels**: Ability to tag settings with labels for better organization.
4. **Point-in-Time Replay**: Allows you to view and restore previous versions of settings.
5. **Feature Flag Management**: Dedicated UI for managing feature flags.
6. **Setting Comparison**: Compare configuration settings across different environments.
7. **Enhanced Security**: Integrates with Azure-managed identities and provides encryption of data.
8. **Native Integration**: Provides client libraries for popular frameworks and languages.

## Using App Configuration

The recommended way to integrate App Configuration with your application is through the client libraries provided by Microsoft.

- .NET Core and ASP.NET Core: App Configuration provider for .NET Core
- .NET Framework and ASP.NET: App Configuration builder for .NET
- Java Spring: App Configuration client for Spring Cloud
- JavaScript/Node.js: App Configuration client for JavaScript
- Python: App Configuration client for Python

For other languages or scenarios, you can use the App Configuration REST API directly.

## Next Steps

1. **Create an App Configuration Store**: Set up an App Configuration store in the Azure portal.
2. **Integrate with Your Application**: Use the appropriate client library to connect your application to the App Configuration store.
3. **Manage Configuration Settings**: Explore the features of App Configuration, such as managing hierarchical settings, feature flags, and secure access to sensitive information.
4. **Explore Advanced Scenarios**: Learn how to use App Configuration in more complex scenarios, such as dynamic configuration updates and integration with Azure Key Vault.

# Creating Paired Keys and Values in Azure App Configuration

## Overview

Azure App Configuration stores configuration data as key-value pairs. Each key-value pair has additional metadata, such as a label and a content type.

## Keys

- Keys serve as the names for the key-value pairs.
- It's common to organize keys into a hierarchical namespace using a delimiter like `/` or `:`.
- Keys are case-sensitive and can use any Unicode characters, except for `*`, `,`, and `\`.
- There's a combined size limit of 10,000 characters for a key-value pair.

## Designing Key Namespaces

There are two main approaches to naming keys:

1. **Flat Naming**: A single sequence of characters without any hierarchy.
2. **Hierarchical Naming**: Organize keys into a hierarchy using delimiters.

Hierarchical naming offers several advantages:

- Easier to read and manage
- Simpler to query and retrieve specific portions of configuration data

Example hierarchical key structures:

- Based on component services: `AppName:Service1:ApiEndpoint`, `AppName:Service2:ApiEndpoint`
- Based on deployment regions: `AppName:Region1:DbEndpoint`, `AppName:Region2:DbEndpoint`

## Labels

- Keys can optionally have a label attribute to differentiate values with the same key.
- Labels can be used to create variants of a key, such as for different environments:
  - `AppName:DbEndpoint` with labels `Test`, `Staging`, `Production`
- Labels can also be used to identify key values associated with a particular software build or version.

## Values

- Values assigned to keys are also Unicode strings.
- There's an optional user-defined content type associated with each value, which can be used to store information about how the value should be processed.
- All configuration data in App Configuration is encrypted at rest and in transit.

## Next Steps

1. **Create an App Configuration Store**: Set up an App Configuration store in the Azure portal.
2. **Add Key-Value Pairs**: Use the Azure portal, CLI, or SDK to add key-value pairs to your App Configuration store.
3. **Explore Hierarchical Keys and Labels**: Organize your configuration data using a hierarchical key structure and leverage labels to create variants.
4. **Integrate with Your Application**: Use the appropriate client library to connect your application to the App Configuration store and retrieve the necessary configuration data.

# Manage Application Features with Azure App Configuration

## Feature Management Overview

Feature management decouples feature release from code deployment and enables quick changes to feature availability using feature flags.

## Key Concepts

- **Feature Flag**: A variable with a binary state (on/off) that controls whether a specific code block runs or not.
- **Feature Manager**: An application package that handles the lifecycle of all feature flags in an application, providing additional functionality like caching and updating feature flag states.
- **Filter**: A rule for evaluating the state of a feature flag, such as user group, device type, location, time window, etc.

## Implementing Feature Flags

- Basic pattern:

  ```csharp
  if (featureFlag) {
      // Run the feature code
  }
  ```

- Set flag value statically or based on rules:

  ```csharp
  bool featureFlag = true;
  bool featureFlag = isBetaUser();
  ```

- Use `else` block for alternative code path

## Declaring Feature Flags

Each feature flag has a name and a list of filters used to evaluate its state. Filters define the use cases for when a feature should be enabled.

Example in `appsettings.json`:

```json
"FeatureManagement": {
    "FeatureA": true,
    "FeatureB": false,
    "FeatureC": {
        "EnabledFor": [
            {
                "Name": "Percentage",
                "Parameters": {
                    "Value": 50
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

## Feature Flag Repository

To manage feature flags, externalize them from your application code. Azure App Configuration is a centralized repository for feature flags.

## Next Steps

1. **Set up an Azure App Configuration Store**: Create an App Configuration store in the Azure portal to serve as your feature flag repository.
2. **Declare Feature Flags**: Use the App Configuration UI or APIs to define your application's feature flags, including their names and associated filters.
3. **Integrate with Your Application**: Leverage the client library for your language/framework (e.g., .NET, Java, JavaScript) to access the feature flags from your application code.
4. **Manage Feature Flags**: Adjust the state of your feature flags in the App Configuration store to enable or disable features without redeploying your application.

# Securing App Configuration Data

## Overview

You can secure your app configuration data in Azure App Configuration using the following features:

1. **Customer-Managed Keys**
2. **Private Endpoints**
3. **Managed Identities**

## Customer-Managed Keys

- Azure App Configuration encrypts sensitive information at rest using a 256-bit AES encryption key.
- With customer-managed keys, App Configuration uses a managed identity to authenticate with Azure Key Vault and wrap/unwrap the encryption key.
- This ensures the encryption key is managed by the customer and not Microsoft.

## Enable Customer-Managed Keys

To enable customer-managed keys, you need:

- Standard tier Azure App Configuration instance
- Azure Key Vault with soft-delete and purge-protection enabled
- An RSA or RSA-HSM key in the Key Vault

Then, you need to:

1. Assign a managed identity to the App Configuration instance
2. Grant the identity `GET`, `WRAP`, and `UNWRAP` permissions in the Key Vault access policy

## Use Private Endpoints

- Private endpoints allow clients on a virtual network (VNet) to securely access the App Configuration store over a private link.
- This eliminates exposure to the public internet and increases security.
- Helps you:
  - Secure your app configuration details by blocking public endpoint access
  - Increase VNet security by ensuring data doesn't escape the VNet
  - Securely connect from on-premises networks to the App Configuration store

## Managed Identities

- Managed identities from Azure Active Directory allow App Configuration to access other Azure services, like Key Vault.
- Two types:
  - System-assigned identity tied to the App Configuration store
  - User-assigned identity as a standalone Azure resource

## Assign Managed Identities

To assign a managed identity using the Azure CLI:

For system-assigned identity:

```bash
az appconfig identity assign --name myTestAppConfigStore --resource-group myResourceGroup
```

For user-assigned identity:

1. Create the identity:

   ```bash
   az identity create --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myUserAssignedIdentity
   ```

2. Assign the identity to the App Configuration store:

   ```bash
   az appconfig identity assign --name myTestAppConfigStore --resource-group myResourceGroup --identities /subscriptions/[subscription id]/resourcegroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Manage
   ```
