# Ethics in Tech

## The Code I'm Still ashamed of

What stuck out most to me was the fact that when the article was published there were still ongoing litigation regarding the drug. The fact that there were lawsuits points to the unethicalness of what this drug company was doing. It relates to ethics because there is a moral dilemma between what's best for the company versus what's best for consumer. 

## Big Data is our generation’s civil rights issue, and we don’t know it

I agree with the concerns raised in this article. The public only has a small idea of how our data is used. There is lack of informed consent that is happening when a company just collects as much data as possible before the company or the user knows what is going to be done with said data. There is also potential for people to discriminated based on their daily activities or how they spend their money. A value can be ascribed to someone based one what a company decides it morally acceptable to them.
