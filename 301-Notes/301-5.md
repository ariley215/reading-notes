# Putting it All Together

*single responsibility principle* - a component should ideally only do one thing; have one job.

- creating reusable and composable components that can be easily combined to build complex systems.

*‘static’ version* - Doesn't involve dynamic data or user interactions.

Version that focuses on structure and layout.

- After initial build out add *dynamic behavior*
  - user input handling
  - fetching data
  - udating UI based on changes
    - using state.

Is it State?

1. Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it isn’t state.
2. Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it isn’t state.
3. Can you compute it based on existing state or props in your component? If so, it definitely isn’t state!

Generally, state should be lifted to the lowest common ancestor of the components that need access to that state.
  
- So that the state is shared across all the components that may need it without having to repeat information.

*higher-order function* - functions that can take other functions as arguments or functions that can return functions.
 

Line 2 is returning a function(m) that can check it's value against the paramenter(n)

```javascript

function greaterThan(n) {
  return m => m > n;
}
let greaterThan10 = greaterThan(10);
console.log(greaterThan10(11));
// → true

```

 Map and Reduce - both require call back functions, making them higher order functions.

- Map applies a function to each item in an array to create a new array of values.
