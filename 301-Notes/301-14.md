# Diversity and Inclusion in Tech

The decline of women in computer science coincided with several societal and cultural shifts, particularly in the 1980s and 1990s. 

Marketing campaigns often targeted boys, depicting them as the primary users and gamers, reinforcing gender stereotypes.

- Men/boys had small home computers. 
- 1984 adds for computers were aimed at boys in the 80's and 90's

Early exposure to technology and computing can influence career choices. If boys are more likely to have hands-on experience with computers from a young age, they may feel more comfortable and confident pursuing computer science as a career later on. 

- Diverse teams are smarter and more creative
- Diverse companies perform better.
  - “female representation in top management leads to an increase of $42 million in firm value.”
- Failing to attract and hire employees from underrepresented backgrounds leads companies to miss out on incredible talent.
- Diverse companies can better serve a diverse user base.
- When the employees of an organization better represent their users and desired users, they will build more effectively for those groups
  - Result in products that are more user-friendly, adaptable, and appealing to a global and varied audience.
