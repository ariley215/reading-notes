REST and CRUD

REST:

REST is an architectural style for designing networked applications, and it defines a set of constraints to be used when creating web services.
RESTful APIs use HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) to perform CRUD operations on resources.

CRUD:

CRUD is an acronym for Create, Read, Update, and Delete, which are the basic operations that can be performed on data.
In the context of RESTful APIs, these CRUD operations map to HTTP methods as follows:

Create: POST

Read: GET

Update: PUT or PATCH

Delete: DELETE

PUT and PATCH can be used to  update a record through an API
GET, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE require an ID parameter

### Creating a RESTful API in 5 steps

1. Define endpoints and resources
2. Use HTTP methods for CRUD operations.
3. Set up status codes for data retrival.
4. Define format for requests and responses.
  - like JSON
5. Use API keys or other methods to authorize access.
