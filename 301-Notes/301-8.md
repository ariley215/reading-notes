**REST** Representational State Transfer

- REST APIs are designed around a stateless communication model.

*â€˜chatty'* web API - API that requires a large number of requests to perform a single operation. 

- t can lead to increased latency, higher bandwidth usage, and more complex client implementations.

An identifier of a resource is called a *Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)*. An example of a URI is "https://example.com/users/123" where "123" is the identifier of a specific user resource.

- They are based on nouns (resources) rather than verbs (actions). They should represent the entities that the API deals with.
- "https://api.example.com/v1/products" where "products" is the resource representing a collection of products.

What are the most common HTTP verbs?

- GET
  - successful status code: 200
  - unsuccessful code: 404 or 403
    - 404 Not Found (if the resource is not found) or 403 Forbidden (if the client does not have permission to access the resource).
- POST
  - successful status code: 201 Created
- PUT
- PATCH
- DELETE
