# State and Props

![React Diagram](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:2000/format:webp/0*0saPKFiTUk6W3FYp)

*component lifecycle events*- the methods that can be used during the lifecycle of the component

**Mounting**, **Updating**, and **Unmounting** are the three phases of the component lifecycle.

-Constructor, static getDerivedStateFromProps, render, componentDidMount, and UNSAFE_componentWillMount all occur in this order during **mounting**.
-A component is **updated** or state changes then it is rerendered.
-When a component is being removed from the DOM. componentWillUnmount is the only lifecycle event during this phase.

*constructors* can be used to assign state using this.state or to bind event handle methods to an instance.

Render is the only required method in a class component.

constructor -> render ->  -> componentDidMount -> React Updates -> componentWillUnmount

*componentDidMount()*- method is invoked immediately after a component is mounted.

Pass in the props:

-Classes
-Functions
-React Elements
-Functions
-Data

State is inside of the component and can be updated inside, props are passed into a component, they exist outside of the component.

When do we re-render our application? when the user action updates what is being displayed.

User Interface State:

-Active tab in a tabbed interface.
-Whether a modal or dialog is open or closed.
-Form input values.
-Collapsed or expanded sections of a page.

Authentication State:

-User login status (logged in or logged out).
-User authentication tokens.
-User roles and permissions.

Application State:

-Global settings and configurations.
-Theme preferences (light mode/dark mode).
-Language preferences.

Navigation State:

-Current route or URL.
-Navigation history stack.

Data Fetching State:

-Loading indicators for asynchronous data fetching.
-Success or error messages from API calls.
-Cached data to avoid unnecessary server requests.
