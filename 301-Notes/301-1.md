# Introduction to React and Components

## Definitions
<dl>
  <dt>Component</dt>
  <dd>-A modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable unit of well-defined functionality. It encapsulates its implementation and exports it as a higher-level interface. Components interact with other components, having a clearly defined interface and a recommended behavior common to all components within an architecture.</dd>
  <dt>Props</dt>
  <dd>- Special keyword in React, which stands for properties and is being used for passing data from one component to another.</dd>
  <dd>- Data with props are being passed in a uni-directional flow. (one way from parent to child)</dd>
  <dd>- Props data is read-only, which means that data coming from the parent should not be changed by child components.</dd>

## Views of a Component:

**Object-Oriented View**:

A set of cooperating classes where each class defines attributes and operations.

**Conventional View**:

A functional element or module that integrates processing logic, internal data structures, and an interface.

**Process-Related View**:

Building a system from existing components in a library, selecting and using them to populate the architecture.

## Characteristics of Components:

Reusability:Components are designed to be reused in different situations or applications.

Replaceability:Components can be freely substituted with other similar components.

Not Context Specific:Components are designed to operate in different environments and contexts.

Extensibility: A component can be extended to provide new behavior.

Encapsulation:Components hide internal details and expose interfaces for functionality.

Independence:Components have minimal dependencies on other components.

## Principles of Component-Based Design:

Decomposition: Decompose the software into reusable, cohesive, and encapsulated component units.

Interface Specification:Each component has its own interface, specifying required and provided ports, hiding implementation details.

Ease of Extension: A component should be extendable without modifying existing parts.

Abstraction:Components depend on abstractions, not concrete components.

Connectors:Components are connected by interfaces specifying their interaction.

## Component-Level Design Guidelines:

Naming Conventions: Use meaningful names for components, derived from the problem domain.

Independence:Identify independent entities as new components.

Modeling:Model dependencies and inheritance through interfaces.

## Advantages of Component-Based Design:

Ease of Deployment: New versions can replace existing ones without impacting other components or the system.

Reduced Cost:Use of third-party components spreads development and maintenance costs.

Ease of Development:Components provide well-known interfaces for defined functionality.

Reusability: Components can be used across multiple applications or systems.

Reliability: The reliability of individual components enhances the overall system reliability.

System Maintenance: Easy to change and update implementation without affecting the rest of the system.

Independence: Components can be developed independently and connected flexibly.

## Using Props

Passing Props: In the parent component, include attributes when rendering the child component. These attributes become the props.

Receiving Props: In the child component, access the passed props using the props object.

Using Props: Utilize the received props within the child component's render or functions.

Dynamic Props: Props can be of any type, including functions or objects.
