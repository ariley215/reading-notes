# Passing Functions as Props

What does .map() return?

Returns a new array created by applying a provided function to each element of the original array

If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React?

.map function to loop through an array and create React elements for each item.

Each list item needs a unique *key*

Purpose of a *key* - to help identify which items have changed, been added, or been removed. It provides a way for React to efficiently update the user interface by minimizing the number of manipulations it has to make to the DOM.

*spread operator* - allows you to spread elements of an iterable (like an array or a string) or object properties into another array or object.

List 4 things that the spread operator can do.

1. Combine arrays
2. Add new items to an array
3. Combine Objects
4. Clone Arrays and Objects

Combine two arrays:

``` javascript

const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
const arr2 = [4, 5, 6];
const combinedArray = [...arr1, ...arr2];
// combinedArray is now [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

Add a new item to an array:

``` javascript
const originalArray = [1, 2, 3];
const newArray = [...originalArray, 4];
// newArray is now [1, 2, 3, 4]

```

Combine two objects into one:

``` javascript
const obj1 = { a: 1, b: 2 };
const obj2 = { c: 3, d: 4 };
const combinedObject = { ...obj1, ...obj2 };
// combinedObject is now { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4 }


```

First step that the developer does to pass functions between components -- define the function in the parent component.

In your own words, what does the handleClick function do? it handles a click event. It allows the user to trigger diffferent functions.

Pass a method from a parent component into a child component by passing it as a *prop*
-In the parent component, include the method in the props of the child component when rendering it.

```javascript
// ParentComponent.js
import React from 'react';
import ChildComponent from './ChildComponent';

const ParentComponent = () => {
  const myMethod = () => {
    // Some functionality
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <ChildComponent myMethod={myMethod} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default ParentComponent;

// /////////////////////////////////

// ChildComponent.js
import React from 'react';

const ChildComponent = ({ myMethod }) => {
  // Use myMethod in the child component
  return (
    <button onClick={myMethod}>
      Click me
    </button>
  );
};

export default ChildComponent;


```

In the child component, you can invoke the passed method by calling it as a function.

```javascript

<button onClick={myMethod}>
  Click me
</button>

```
