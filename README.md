## Growth Mindset

Growth midset is understanding that you can gain the skills through continued practice despite challenges that arise. It doesn't take just innate talent or intelligence to be successful in an area, **you can develop into someone who has those talents.**

>A growth mindset is synonymous with a love of learning.

### Reminders
1. If it's hard, you're growing.
2. Frustration is not always a bad thing.
3. If it was easy, everyone would do it.
