# Programming with JavaScript

## Functions

*Control Flow*- the order that the computer executes the script statements

*JavaScript Function*- a block of code designed to perform a particular task.

- The name of the function.

- A list of parameters to the function,enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.

- The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly braces, { /* â€¦ */ }.

*Invoke - or call*- ACTUALLY using the function.

FUNCTION DECLARATION

Declaring a function means making one - a command/rule

Parameters in the () - placeholder names for information the function will need to do its job.

When you pass an object as a parameter, if the function changes the object's properties, that change is visible outside the function.

***Invoke the function and store it's return (result) in a new variable.

Function Expression- another way to declare a function
    
- function expressions can only be invoked after defining them, otherwise you'll get errors.
